            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Reviewers should not share any information from an assigned manuscript with outsiders without the prior permission from the Editor or preserve the data from an assigned manuscript.

            <p class="text-muted">
                Reviewer with fair expertise should complete the review.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">

            <h4>Constructive Assessment</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Reviewer comments should appreciate positive aspects of the work, identify negative aspects constructively, and indicate the enhancement needed. A reviewer should explain and support his or her judgment clearly enough that Editors and Authors can understand the basis of the comments.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The reviewer should ensure that an observation or argument that has been previously reported be accompanied by a relevant citation and should immediately alert the Editor when he or she becomes aware of duplicate publication.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                A reviewer should not use any kind of abusive language while commenting on an article.

            <p class="text-muted">
                Judgment of each article should be done without any bias and personal interest by the assigned reviewer.

            <h4>Impartiality and Integrity</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Reviewer’s decision should solely depend on scientific merit, relevance to the subject, scope of the journal rather than financial, racial, ethnic origin etc., of the authors.
            </p>

            <h4>Disclosure of conflict of interest</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
                To the extent feasible, the reviewer should minimize the conflict of interest. In such situation, reviewer should notify the editor describing the conflict of interest.

            <p class="text-muted">
